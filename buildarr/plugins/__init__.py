    Buildarr plugin definition.

    To create a Buildarr plugin, set the appropriate
    plugin classes as class attributes to an implementation of this class.

    ```python
    from buildarr.plugins import Plugin
    from buildarr_example.cli import example
    from buildarr_example.config import ExampleConfig
    from buildarr_example.secrets import ExampleSecrets

    class ExamplePlugin(Plugin):
        cli = example
        config = ExampleConfig
        secrets = ExampleSecrets
    ```

    Then, set this class as the entry point for the plugin in your
    Python package configuration.

    Setuptools `setup.py` entry point definition example:
    ```python
    from setuptools import setup

    setup(
        # ...,
        entry_points={
            "buildarr.plugins": [
                "example = buildarr_example.plugin:ExamplePlugin",
            ],
        },
    )
    ```

    Setuptools `setup.cfg` entry point definition example:
    ```ini
    [options.entry_points]
    buildarr.plugins =
        example = buildarr_example.plugin:ExamplePlugin
    ```

    Setuptools `pyproject.toml` entry point definition example:
    ```toml
    [project.entry-points."buildarr.plugins"]
    "example" = "buildarr_example.plugin:ExamplePlugin"
    ```

    Poetry plugin definition example:
    ```toml
    [tool.poetry.plugins."buildarr.plugins"]
    "example" = "buildarr_example.plugin:ExamplePlugin"
    ```
