Constrained string type for a Dummy instance API key.

The type `Password` allows anything as long as it is not an empty string, but is a subclass
of type `pydantic.SecretStr`, allowing Buildarr to hide the value in any logging.

A more complex type for API key might look something like this:

```python
from pydantic import Field, SecretStr
from typing_extensions import Annotated

DummyApiKey = Annotated[SecretStr, Field(min_length=32, max_length=32)]
```
