    In Buildarr, the quality listed first (at the top) is given the highest priority, with
    subsequent qualities given lower priority. Qualities not explicitly defined are
    disabled (not downloaded).

    Sonarr supports grouping multiple qualities together to give them the same priority.
    In Buildarr, these are expressed by giving a `name` to the group, and listing the qualities
    under the `members` attribute.

    For more insight into reasonable values for quality profiles,
    refer to these guides from [WikiArr](https://wiki.servarr.com/sonarr/settings#quality-profiles)
    and TRaSH-Guides ([WEB-DL](https://trash-guides.info/Sonarr/Sonarr-Release-Profile-RegEx/),

    Individual qualities can be specified using the name (e.g. `Bluray-480p`).

    priority level. A new version of the episode will not be downloaded if it is
    at least one of the qualities listed in the group, until a higher quality
    version is found.
